# Overview
This repository contains work on exploring and analyzing the capabilities of the GPT-2 model in natural language processing tasks. The project aims to understand the intricacies of language models, particularly focusing on text generation, summarization and question answering.

# Features
- Implementation of GPT-2 for diverse NLP tasks.
- Datasets including CORD-19, Spotify 30,000 Songs, Jokes and a custom chemistry dataset.
- Evaluations using perplexity, ROUGE, and BLEU scores.

# Future Work
Plan to extend the capabilities of the GPT-2 model to include categorization tasks on custom dataset.
